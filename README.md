Moonlight Client for macOS 10.13+ w/ HEVC support

This is an open source implementation of the NVIDIA Streaming Protocol for macOS and is based on moonlight-ios.

macOS supports native HEVC playback as of version 10.13, since the moonlight-chrome client lacks this feature I implemented it in a standalone, native macOS-Client. In addition to the HEVC support I hope to archive performance and latency improvements.

Status: early development, but already working
